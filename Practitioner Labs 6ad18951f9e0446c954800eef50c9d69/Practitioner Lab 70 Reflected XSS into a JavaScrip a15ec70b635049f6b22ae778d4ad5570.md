# Practitioner Lab 70: Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with single quote and backslash-escaped

---

This lab contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality. The reflection occurs inside a JavaScript string with single quotes and backslashes escaped.

To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that breaks out of the JavaScript string and calls the alert function.

I started playing with the quotes and I put a </script> after to see how it would react. The â€˜ was backslashed but the <script> tag had exited the main tag. 

This meant that I could still execute quote.

Here is how it looked.
