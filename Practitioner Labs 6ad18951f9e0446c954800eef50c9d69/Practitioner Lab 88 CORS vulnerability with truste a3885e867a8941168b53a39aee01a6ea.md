# Practitioner Lab 88 : CORS vulnerability with trusted insecure protocols

---

This website has an insecure CORS configuration in that it trusts all subdomains regardless of the protocol.

To solve the lab, craft some JavaScript that uses CORS to retrieve the administrator's API key and upload the code to your exploit server. The lab is solved when you successfully submit the administrator's API key.

Here I find the page that gets the api keys.

Now I will use this to test what type of access control policy it has.

I found xss that could likely be exploited.

The window that opens has its own address. 

Here I found a subdomain that has an xss vulnerability. I can use this to exploit it .

Here we can see that it is explitable.

```

Using this payload I was able to get it.

This solved the lab.
