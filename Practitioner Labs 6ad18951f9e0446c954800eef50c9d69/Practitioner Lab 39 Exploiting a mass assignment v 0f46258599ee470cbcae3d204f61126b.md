# Practitioner Lab 39: Exploiting a mass assignment vulnerability

---

To solve the lab, find and exploit a mass assignment vulnerability to buy a **Lightweight l33t Leather Jacket**. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`.

The first thing that I am going to do is to start attempting to access the /api and the other commonly used.

I did find /api 

Using the functionality of the checkout I got a 100% discount and was able to buy the item without an issue thus solving the lab.

Another way to solve this lab using Burp would of been to change the request

After doing this you can get a discount of 100%
