# Practitioner Lab 130 : Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to bypass front-end security controls, CL.TE vulnerability

---

This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. There's an admin panel at `/admin`, but the front-end server blocks access to it.

To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server that accesses the admin panel and deletes the user `carlos`.

It gave me a timeout telling me thats its a CLTE.

Using this payload I was able to make a request to the backend but it said unauthorized.

After sending this request I managed to access the admin page.

The x=extra makes it so that the next request is as if it was part of the body of the initial /admin request thus it allows me to have multiple host headers.

Now I need to open this site on my broswer and just capture the request.
