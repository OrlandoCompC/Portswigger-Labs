# Practitioner Lab 60: Exploiting blind XXE to exfiltrate data using a malicious external DTD

---

This lab has a "Check stock" feature that parses XML input but does not display the result.

To solve the lab, exfiltrate the contents of the `/etc/hostname` file.

I started by going into the exploit server and hosting the DTD

I then did a request to this server from the xml

this gave me an error but I was still able to get the hostname from the logs.
