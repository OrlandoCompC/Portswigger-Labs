# Practitioner Lab 100: Exploiting Java deserialization with Apache Commons

---

This lab uses a serialization-based session mechanism and loads the Apache Commons Collections library. Although you don't have source code access, you can still exploit this lab using pre-built gadget chains.

To solve the lab, use a third-party tool to generate a malicious serialized object containing a remote code execution payload. Then, pass this object into the website to delete the `morale.txt` file from Carlos's home directory.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

The first thing the website showed was that the session cookie is a java object.
