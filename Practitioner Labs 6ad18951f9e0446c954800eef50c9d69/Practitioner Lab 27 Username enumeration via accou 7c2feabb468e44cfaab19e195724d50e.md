This means that the valid user is apache because it is the only account that was locked out.

It took. 12 attempts before apache got locked out. Now I need to try again on that account with 10 times.

This password were used to try so now I just need to try another. 10 passwords that are not these. 

i had to redo the lab because the server connection was lost and it reset the user sadly.
