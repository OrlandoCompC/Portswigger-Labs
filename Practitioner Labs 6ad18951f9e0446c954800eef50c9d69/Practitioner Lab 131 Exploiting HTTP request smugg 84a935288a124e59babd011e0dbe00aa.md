# Practitioner Lab 131: Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to bypass front-end security controls, TE.CL vulnerability

---

This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the back-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. There's an admin panel at /admin, but the front-end server blocks access to it.

To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server that accesses the admin panel and deletes the user carlos.

This was blocked by the front end meaning that the front end is using TE

This means its a TECL

```

here I am sending a valid chunk data but an invalid content length which only has the 72/r/n 

meaning the /admin request is getting smuggled.

The message indicates that only a local user can access the admin panel so I need to use the host header and change it into localhost

After changing the host value to local host I was able to gain access to the admin panel.

This is payload deleted the user and solved the lab.
