# Practitioner Lab 40: Exploiting server-side parameter pollution in a query string

---

To solve the lab, log in as the `administrator` and delete `carlos`.

I went and tried to reset the password.

I then went and started trying to use the # which gave me an error mentioning field.

I then went into the javascript and found the keyword reset_token

After doing this I put it on the url and that gave me the option to change the password
