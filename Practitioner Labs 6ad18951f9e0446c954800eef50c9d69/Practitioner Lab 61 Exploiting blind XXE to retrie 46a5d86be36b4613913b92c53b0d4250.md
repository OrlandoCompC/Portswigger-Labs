# Practitioner Lab 61: Exploiting blind XXE to retrieve data via error messages

---

This lab has a "Check stock" feature that parses XML input but does not display the result.

To solve the lab, use an external DTD to trigger an error message that displays the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

The lab contains a link to an exploit server on a different domain where you can host your malicious DTD.

I started by hosting the DTD on the server

now I will send a request with hopes it gets an error

here the error has the contents of the file.

This is an example of information disclosure.
